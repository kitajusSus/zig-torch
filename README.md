# important 27.02.2025
I've changed few thing like:
- architecture of the project
- added benchmark

mm.zig is main file with matrix multiplication function. the main problem is that i dont know how to build this, to make it work as a independent library in python, I lost an idea to make "faster pytorch", now im focused to something that can be used with or without pytorch. 


# zig-pytorch
As a man who is trying to understand zig and write usefull code in other language than python (or try to write something usefull), I get an idea of creating something what is using zig to optize pytorch, make is faster, more reliable. I don't know if it's going to work, but I need to do it my own as a motivation do study. 
# I've seen this in my dream
# 0. Basic know-how
PyTorch is written in C++ and gives API in this language, BUT ZIG GIVES US built in tools to compile code in C/C++. I can define functions from C++ in zig and use it in my code. [000_example.zig](mm.zig). As you see, something works, and the plan is  rewrite/build from scrach pytorch functions in zig and do something with it. 
## What do I need
- Write pytorch functions in zig.
- Check it everything work on python 

# 1. Creating basic functions from pytorch
## `torch.mm(input, mat2) -> Tensor`
This function takes two tensors 2d (matrix).




# 00. notes

zig build command
` zig build-obj -OReleaseFast -fPIC mm.zig`
`zig build-obj -fcompiler-rt mm.zig -fPIC  -lpthread`
important to create module 
`pip install -e .` // `python setup.py install`





but there is a progres:
```bash
                          (base)

# Updated Progress 8.01.2025
The issues mentioned above have been fixed. The current implementation is still not faster than PyTorch, but significant improvements have been made. The `mm.zig` file has been optimized, and the multithreading issues have been resolved. The setup process has been streamlined, and the performance comparison with PyTorch is now more accurate.

# Next Steps
- Continue optimizing the `mm.zig` file to further improve performance.
- Explore additional techniques for optimizing matrix multiplication.
- Keep the community updated on progress and share any new findings.
