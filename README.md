# zig-pytorch
As a man who is trying to understand zig and write usefull code in other language than python (or try to write something usefull), I get an idea of creating something what is using zig to optize pytorch, make is faster, more reliable. I don't know if it's going to work, but I need to do it my own as a motivation do study. 
# I've seen this in my dream
# 0. Basic know-how
PyTorch is written in C++ and gives API in this language, BUT ZIG GIVES US built in tools to compile code in C/C++. I can define functions from C++ in zig and use it in my code. [000_example.zig](000_example.zig).



# 1. Creating basic functions from pytorch
## `torch.mm(input, mat2) -> Tensor`
This function takes two
